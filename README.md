# CSMC 516- Detection of Patronizing and Condescending Language


The detection of Patronizing and Condescending language:

In this github repository, there is a link to the google collaboratory python script that we have created to solve the problem of PCL detection as well as the data for this project, dontpatronizeme_pcl.tsv. 

With how the permissions are set up, one should be able to click on Python_Script_PCL_Detection.ipynb, click on the open in collab badge to open collab in a new window, and the program should be able to run. When it comes to authroizing the data, just log in with any google account and it should work. A user should be able to modify the hyper parameters in the hyperparameter code block, but these changes can not be saved. The hyperparameters saved are the default/suggested parameters. 

In the neural network block, you will find 3 different networks of varying complexity. We did not see any increase in the accuracy of the results from increasing the size/complexity of the neural network. Larger networks seemed to be overtrained more easily and have more various results due to the many local minima.
