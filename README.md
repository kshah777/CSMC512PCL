# CSMC 516- Detection of Patronizing and Condescending Language


The detection of Patronizing and Condescending language:

In this github repository, there is a link to the google collaboratory python script that we have created to solve the problem of PCL detection as well as the data for this project, dontpatronizeme_pcl.tsv. 

With how the permissions are set up, on should be able to click on Python_Script_PCL_Detection.ipynb, click on the open in collab badge to open collab in a new window, and the program should be able to run. When it comes to authroizing the data, just log in with any google account and it should work. A user should be able to modify the hyper parameters in the hyperparameter code block, but these changes can not be saved. The hyperparameters saved are the default/suggested parameters. 

If you have any issues, please reach out to barrowqa@vcu.edu
